Day 1: It was mainly about the basics of Machine Learning (ML).
First, what is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions.

Next, why is Machine Learning needed?

It simplifies human work

Learns from past data

Improves performance automatically over time

Refines the model by learning from failures

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning:
Learns from labeled data (input + output).
Example: A model trained on emails labeled as Spam or Not Spam.

2. Unsupervised Learning:
Learns from unlabeled data.
Example: A shopping website understanding different types of customers without predefined categories.

3. Reinforcement Learning:
Learns through trial and error using rewards and penalties.
Example: A car learning how to drive by interacting with the environment.

Basic ML Workflow:
Problem → Data → Model → Prediction

Define the problem

Collect and prepare data

Train the model

Make predictions or decisions

Task 1: Simple definition of ML
Machine Learning is a technique where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions on their own.

Task 2:
Predicting future product demand in a store.

Task 3: Problem Breakdown

Problem Statement:
Predict how many units of a product will be sold tomorrow.

Input Data:

Past sales data

Date/day

Price

Promotions

Expected Output:
Number of units to be sold (demand prediction).
